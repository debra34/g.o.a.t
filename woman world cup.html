        <h1>ashely</h1>
        <i>Ashleigh Megan Plumptre (born 8 May 1998) is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for the Nigeria national team. Formerly an England youth international, she made her senior Nigeria debut in February 2022.[3][4]

            Club career
            Youth career
            Born in Leicester, Plumptre grew up and attended primary school in Melton Mowbray.[2] She began playing football at age 4 when she joined Asfordby Amateurs. At age 8, she joined the Leicester City Centre of Excellence, spending seven years with the club playing from under-10 to under-15 level. She left Leicester to join Birmingham City's under-17 team in 2013 where she also had the opportunity to train with the senior WSL 1 team. In 2014, Plumptre briefly joined third-tier FA Women's Premier League side Derby County's Centre of Excellence.[5]
            
            Notts County
            Plumptre joined WSL 1 side Notts County in 2014. She made her senior debut on 24 August 2014, as a 57th minute substitute for Caitlin Friend in a 1–0 defeat to Liverpool.[6] In doing so she become the youngest Notts County debutant at 16 years 108 days.[5] She made her first start in a 1–1 WSL 1 draw with Manchester City on 3 September.[7] Four days later she appeared as a substitute at the start of extra-time during a League Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.[8]
            
            On 1 August 2015, Plumptre was an unused substitute for the 2015 FA Women's Cup final, the first to be played at Wembley Stadium.[9] She scored her first and only goal for Notts County on 30 August 2015 in a 5–0 League Cup group stage victory at home to second-tier Yeovil Town.[10][11] Notts County also reached the League Cup final in 2015, losing to Arsenal 3–0 with Plumptre an unused substitute for the second consecutive cup final.[12]
            
            USC Trojans
            In 2016, Plumptre moved to the United States to play college soccer at the University of Southern California. As a freshman she made 17 substitute appearances as a midfielder for the USC Trojans including in every round of the NCAA postseason. She played 27 minutes of the College Cup final as USC beat West Virginia 3–1 to claim the second national championship in program history.[5][13] She scored her first collegiate goal on 22 October 2017, the game winner in a 2–1 victory over Washington State.[14] After only two starts in another 17 appearances as a sophomore, she became a starter as a junior in 2018, starting in 19 of 20 appearances. In 2019, Plumptre transitioned to playing centre-back and started all 23 of USC's games during the season that included a postseason run to the NCAA Tournament quarter-finals. Her performances were recognised individually with All-Pacific first team and All-Pac-12 second team honours in 2019.[5] Majoring in human biology, Plumptre's academic success earned her Pac-12 academic recognition in 2017 and 2018. She was also named to the 2018 CoSIDA Academic All-District second team and 2019 United Soccer Coaches Scholar All-America second team.[15]
            
            LA Galaxy OC
            In March 2019, Plumptre signed to play in the UWS with LA Galaxy OC during the college offseason.[16] The team finished second in the West Conference behind Calgary Foothills during the regular season before winning the Championship final against the same opposition.[17]
            
            Leicester City
            In December 2019, Plumptre elected to forgo the 2020 NWSL College Draft coming out of college despite projecting as a late-first round or early-second round pick[18] and instead returned to England, rejoining hometown club Leicester City in the FA Women's Championship. The Foxes had reportedly also beaten FA WSL competition to her signature.[19] She made her senior Leicester City debut on 19 January 2020, registering an assist on an Ella Rutherford goal in a 3–1 win over Crystal Palace.[20] Plumptre's debut season with Leicester was limited to three league appearances as the season was curtailed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Leicester were awarded sixth-place on a points-per-game basis.[21][22]
            
            Ahead of the 2020–21 season, Leicester City Women were taken over by King Power having previously been an independent club with a formal affiliation to the Foxes.[23] The club became fully professional for the first time in the process.[24] On 4 April 2021, Leicester City clinched the league title with a 2–0 win over London City Lionesses, their twelfth consecutive league victory dating back to 4–1 defeat at the hands of the same opposition on 1 November 2020. The result earned Leicester their first ever promotion to the top-flight FA WSL.[25] Despite a significant summer recruitment drive to attract WSL talent in the team's bid for promotion, Plumptre remained a key figure and played in all but one game during the title win as well as all four League Cup games as Leicester reached the knockout stage for the first time before defeat in the semi-finals.[26]
            
            Plumptre left Leicester City following the expiration of her contract in July 2023.[27]
            
            International career
            England
            Plumptre has represented England at under-15, under-17, under-19[28] and under-23 level including at two tournaments: the 2014 and 2015 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship.[3][5] Predominantly a forward or attacking midfielder at youth level, she scored twice during a 9–0 win over Moldova in the 2015 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship qualifying round.[29] In 2016, 17-year-old Plumptre was the youngest player named to the under-23 team for the 2016 La Manga Tournament.[30] She made a combined 30 appearances at youth level, scoring 10 goals.[5][31]
            
            Nigeria
            Having earlier expressed an interest in representing Nigeria at senior level in June 2021,[32] Plumptre received her first call-up for an eight-day training camp held in Austria the following month. She qualifies to play for Nigeria through her paternal grandfather, a Yoruba from Lagos.[33][4] She made an unofficial debut on 23 July 2021, starting in a 1–0 friendly win over Slovenian 1. SŽNL club Olimpija Ljubljana.[34][35] In November 2021, she attended a training camp in Nigeria. In late December 2021, she was officially cleared by FIFA to represent Nigeria.[36][37] She made her official debut on 18 February 2022, starting in a 2–0 win over Ivory Coast during 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations qualification.[38]
            
            On 16 June 2023, she was included in the 23-player Nigeria squad for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.[39] She started all four games, helping Nigeria to keep three clean sheets as the team reached the round of 16 before being eliminated by England on penalties after a 0–0 draw.[40]
            
            Personal life
            Plumptre's grandfather was born in Nigeria.[41][42] She grew up supporting Leicester City and attended the parade when the men's team won the 2015–16 Premier League title.[43]
            
            In 2017, Plumptre was invited to the White House as part of USC's National Championship winning celebrations.[2][44]

            <i>Chloe Maggie Kelly (born 15 January 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Women's Super League club Manchester City and the England national team. She previously played for Arsenal and Everton and represented England on the under-17, under-19 and under-20 national teams.

                At the UEFA Women's Euro 2022, Kelly came off the substitutes' bench to score the winning goal in the final, securing the team their first major trophy.
                
                Early life
                Kelly was born on 15 January 1998 to Noel Kelly, a machinery engineer, and his wife Jane, and was raised in the West London district of Hanwell. She was the youngest of seven siblings.[2][3] She began playing football at a young age with her five brothers.[4] She often played in football cages in Windmill Park, in Ealing, which she credits with making her the player she became; as part of the "Where Greatness Is Made" campaign, a plaque honouring Kelly was installed at the cages in 2022.[5] Before joining Arsenal's Centre of Excellence, she played for Queens Park Rangers.[2] She travelled two hours round trip by train as a young teenager to train with Arsenal.[2] Her footballing idol when she was growing up was Bobby Zamora, once also a Queens Park Rangers player.[6]
                
                Club career
                Arsenal
                On 23 July 2015, aged 17, Kelly made her full debut for the Arsenal first team in the Continental Cup against Watford, scoring her first goal just 22 minutes into the match.[7] She made her second appearance for the club during a 2–1 win over Notts County, subbing in for Rachel Yankey in the 54th minute.[8]
                
                
                Kelly during her Arsenal debut, July 2015
                In February 2016, Kelly signed her first senior contract.[9] She made one appearance in the team's 5–1 win over Sunderland on 25 June, before being loaned to FA WSL 2 side Everton.
                
                After returning to Arsenal in October of the same year, she made three more appearances for Arsenal during the 2016 FA WSL season. The team finished the regular season in third place with a 10–4–2 record.[10] Arsenal also won the 2016 FA Women's Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. Though Kelly was in the squad,[11] she did not play during the team's 1–0 win over Chelsea.[12]
                
                In February 2017, Kelly signed a new contract with Arsenal.[13] She made seven appearances for the club and scored two goals before being loaned to Everton in July.[14]
                
                Everton (loan)
                In June 2016, Kelly joined FA WSL 2 side Everton on a three-month loan in order to gain additional first team experience;.[15] She made nine starts for the Toffees, and scored two goals.[8]
                
                In July 2017, Kelly returned to newly-promoted FA WSL 1 Everton for a second loan spell.[16] Kelly made four appearances for Everton and scored two goals in the remaining months of 2017.[8]
                
                All goals, including Kelly's hat-trick, in Everton 4-0 Oxford
                In the WSL Cup, Kelly scored her first senior hat-trick on 16 November 2017 in a 4–0 victory against Oxford United.

                In January 2018, Kelly made a permanent transfer to Everton on contract through summer 2020, alongside Arsenal teammate Taylor Hinds.[17] She made a total of 15 appearances for Everton during the 2017–18 FA WSL season and scored two goals.[8] Everton finished in ninth place with a 4–12–2 record.[18] During the 2018-19 FA WSL season, Kelly made eleven appearances and scored a goal during the team's 3–3 draw against Brighton & Hove Albion despite playing on an ankle injury throughout the season.[8] Everton finished in 10th place.[19][4]
                
                After having ankle surgery, 2019 marked a turning point for Kelly's career. She scored nine goals in 12 games for Everton during the 2019–20 FA WSL season helping the club climb the table to sixth place. She was the fourth-highest scorer in the league and the top goalscorer for Everton.[20] During the team's second game of the season, Kelly scored a brace lifting Everton to a 2–0 win. Her second goal of the match – a long-range goal – went viral.[21] Kelly was named the league's Player of the Month for September and was shortlisted for October’s award.[21] Kelly's performance during the early part of the season earned her a call-up to the national team camp.[21] In January 2020, Kelly scored a hat trick against Reading lifting Everton to a 3–1 win. It was the first hat-trick by an Everton player since 2013.[22]
                
                In June 2020, Kelly left Everton after rejecting a new contract.[23]
                
                Manchester City
                On 3 July 2020, it was announced Kelly had signed a two-year contract with Manchester City.[24] In September 2020, she was named to the PFA WSL Team of the Year.[25] On 4 October, she scored a brace against Tottenham Hotspur lifting the team to a 4–1 win.[26] During the team's 3–1 loss to Chelsea a few days later, she converted a penalty kick in the 73rd minute for Manchester City's lone goal of the match.[27]
                
                On 2 May 2021, Kelly suffered an ACL injury.[28][29]
                
                International career
                Kelly has represented England on the senior national team as well as numerous youth national teams, including the under-17 and under-20 squads.
                
                Youth
                In 2014, Kelly competed at the 2014 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in England, coming fourth,[30][31] and the 2015 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in Iceland, exiting in the group stage.[32][33] In November 2015, she scored an equaliser against Italy to earn a draw for the under-19 team.[34]
                
                In August 2018, Kelly was part of the England U20 squad that claimed bronze at the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.
                
                Senior
                Kelly made her senior national team debut in November 2018, coming in as a substitute in a 3–0 friendly win over Austria in Vienna.[35]

                Kelly was named in the England squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2022, which England was hosting, in June 2022.[36][37] On 31 July 2022, Kelly came off the bench to score the winning goal in the 110th minute of the Women's Euro 2022 final match against Germany, securing the win for England in extra time.[38][39] Once she was confirmed onside, she celebrated by removing her shirt and swinging it around her head, revealing a sports bra and receiving a yellow card as a result.[40][41] She was later praised as uniting and empowering women.[42] Kelly's celebration was compared to that of American defender Brandi Chastain, who had also famously celebrated a major championship-deciding goal for a host nation by removing her jersey and revealing her sports bra and had also been celebrated as a women's empowerment figure – in Chastain's case, after she scored the winning penalty for the United States against China in the 1999 Women's World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl. Chastain congratulated her and also said it put "a big smile on my face"[43] and also later swapped shirts with Kelly after England's friendly against the United States at Wembley that October.[44]
                
                2023 Women's World Cup
                On 31 May 2023, Kelly was named to the squad for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in July 2023.[45] She scored in England's 6–1 defeat of China.[46]
                
                She also scored England’s winning penalty in the Round of 16 shootout against Nigeria by blasting the ball emphatically into the top corner.[47]
